## Set Up
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/TheOnlyWayUp/WattpadDownloader/ && cd WattpadDownloader`
2. Build the image: `docker build . -t 'wp_downloader'` (This takes about 2 Minutes)
3. Run the Container: `docker run -d -p 5042:80 wp_downloader`

That's it! You can use your instance at `http://localhost:5042`. API Documentation is available at `http://localhost:5042/docs`.

### Concurrent Requests
The file-based cache struggles with concurrent requests (discussed in TheOnlyWayUp/WattpadDownloader#2 and TheOnlyWayUp/WattpadDownloader#22). If you're downloading a large number of books concurrently, switch to the Redis cache. Assuming you've built the image already:
1. Fill the .env file. Localhost will not work in a docker container unless [`host.docker.internal`](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/features/networking/#i-want-to-connect-from-a-container-to-a-service-on-the-host) or a platform-specific variant is provided.
```
USE_CACHE=true
CACHE_TYPE=redis
REDIS_CONNECTION_URL=redis://username:password@host:port
```


2. Run the container and supply the .env file, `docker run -d -p 5042:80 --env-file .env wp_downloader`
Alternatively, if Redis is running on localhost
2. Modify your `.env` file, replacing `localhost` with `host.docker.internal`. `redis://localhost:6379` should become `redis://host.docker.internal:6379`. Then, start the container, `docker run -d -p 5042:80 --env-file .env --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway wp_downloader`

## Development
- Developers, ensure you have `wkhtmltopdf` available on your PATH. 
- Run `wkhtmltopdf` on your terminal, if you see "Reduced Functionality", run [this script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JazzCore/python-pdfkit/b7bf798b946fa5655f8e82f0d80dec6b6b13d414/ci/before-script.sh) to install a fully featured compilation of `wkhtmltopdf.
